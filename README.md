# 6174

Kaprekar's constant, 6174, is a unique number in mathematics, discovered by Indian mathematician D. R. Kaprekar in 1949. It is known for its role in a process involving four-digit numbers that eventually leads to this constant.

## How it works

**Choosing a Number**:

Start with any four-digit number, where at least two digits are different. For example, 3524.

**Creating Two Numbers**:

Rearrange the digits to form the largest and smallest numbers possible from them. For 3524, the largest is 5432 and the smallest is 2345.

**Subtraction**:

Subtract the smaller number from the larger one. So, 5432 - 2345 = 3087.

**Repeat**:

Repeat this process with the new number.

The fascinating part is that no matter what four-digit number you start with (as long as it has at least two different digits), repeating this process will always lead to the number 6174 in at most seven iterations. Once 6174 is reached, the process will continue yielding 6174: 7641 - 1467 = 6174.

## The application

Clone the code in Visual Studio, run it and test it out.
